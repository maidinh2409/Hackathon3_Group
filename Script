Scene 1: Student Survey Analysis

01_Demi: Luck—check this: 30% of 18–34-year-olds use AI regularly. Only 10% over 55 do. That’s a big gap since young people use AI in school and social media, they’ll drive its growth in our community.
02_Luck: I also made the comparison of Urban and rural, only 5.2% of rural respondents have no AI experience. Places like Kelowna or Prince George are being left behind in the AI wave.
03_Demi: Yeah, it’s not just access—attitudes too. 45% older people think AI eliminates more jobs than it creates. Most say jobs will just change, not disappear.
04_Luck: It makes sense. Older workers may see AI as a threat, especially near retirement. Since young people grew up with tech.
05_Demi: Exactly, we can see that only 25% of young adults are mostly concerned about AI’s impact, but 45% of older adults fear job loss. There’s real fear of being left behind.
06_Luck: And it’s not just age—location matters too. Half of the respondents fear AI will eliminate jobs. One 64-year-old from Kelowna said, “AI will take jobs and hurt the environment.” It’s a double worry—economic and ecological.
07_Demi: So here’s what I’m wondering: Are young people, being tech-native, more worried about misinformation than job loss?
08_Luck: Good question. Let’s take that to Prof. Kris. He might see something that we’re missing.
09_Demi: Agreed. Let’s go now.


Scene 2: Professor Kris’s Office, UBC

01_Professor Kris: Hello, welcome to my office! Demi, Luck, what can I help you with today?
02_Demi: Hey, Kris! We’re currently working on the BC AI survey. It seems that 30% of young people are tech-savvy and use AI regularly, but worry less about jobs. Are their concerns more about misinformation?
03_Prof. Kris: I pull out key insights from my analysis: 
    - 25% mentioned “job loss” while only 15% cited “misinformation” related to deepfakes, fake news
    - We can see that only 20% of youth concerns were about misinformation. 
04_Luck: So, youth care more about truth than jobs? That’s wild.
05_Prof. Kris: Exactly. A comment like “AI’s spreading fake news” scores 10% higher than a comment of “Jobs are gone, my career is over”.
06_Demi: Totally, makes sense. They’ve seen fake content a lot via social media. They’re not as afraid of being replaced. They’re afraid of the world being misled. 
07_Luck: Another point, what about public opinion overall? Any clear pattern?
08_Prof. Kris: Yes. What I observe is 70% of non-AI users gave negative advice like “Stop AI” and “Don’t trust tech”, while only 13% are Positive that focused on “Use AI in healthcare” and “Teach it in schools.”. 
09_Luck: So, experience reduces fear.
10_Prof. Kris: Exactly. Right now, People aren’t saying “Don’t build AI”. And you can see the 13% positive group. They’re the future innovators, educators. Their vision is scalable, but only if we close the trust gap.
11_Luck: Which means we can’t just roll out AI, we also have to roll it out with people.
12_Prof. Kris: Yes. With AI literacy, rural outreach, and inclusive design. The data shows division today, but a path to unity tomorrow.
13_Demi: So, where do we go from here?
14_Prof. Kris: We could dig deeper into age, location, and experience to predict public sentiment in action.
15_Luck: Okay, we will start building the sentiment prediction model.
16_Demi: For me, I’ll map how people’s advice differs based on who they are and their reasons.
17_Prof. Kris: Perfect. Because in the end, data doesn’t speak for itself. It’s our job to give it voice.We could dig deeper into age, location, and experience to predict public sentiment in action.
18_Demi & Luck: Thanks, Professor Kris!
